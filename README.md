# Invisible cloak using Opencv

Harry potter was lucky guy to get a invisible cloak as a gift for christmas. Well I am a muggle and don't have a prophecy. So I made my own cloak with python as my santa. 
In this repo, unlike Harry, I am sharing the code to weave the "invisible cloak" all by ourselves.
